Picasso had given Sabartés great many paintings, drawings and prints during the course of their friendship. Originally Sabartés had planned to set up a museum based on his collection in Málaga, Picasso’s birthplace. It was Picasso himself who suggested that Barcelona would be more appropriate, given his long standing connections with the city.The museum first opened in 1963 and the original collection was made up of Sabartés donation (574 works).",
